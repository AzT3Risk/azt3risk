about_me_description: Hi, I'm Souvik, currently pursuing my MS in Statistics and Computing from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. According to philosophers, Data is the known territory from which one explores the unknown. I believe every data-set has its own story to tell and getting insights out of data is something that I like most. I have a basic understanding of different machine learning algorithms. Currently learning about how to use ML algorithm to solve real-life problems. I have a good understanding of Python and R programming languages and different packages related to data analytics. I have a huge interest in Neural Networks. I know about different functionalities of some BI software(Excel, PowerBI) and SAS for data analytics. I have a passion for sports and music, Football is my favourite sport, and Playing guitar is my hobby. On this website, you can find some of my projects. Have fun browsing through this website and thank you for visiting!
